# Genetic-Algorithm
This is a simple Genetic Algorithm that evolves to find a string that's provided by the user.

There are certain things you are able to change in order to optimize the algorithm to find a certain 
solution faster.
These include:
-The population size (Indicated by the variable: "size")
-The generation size (variable: "generations")
-Probability of mutation (variable: "p_mutation")
-Probability of crossover (variable: "p_crossover")

Lastly, you are able to change the "goal" variable to find whatever string you are looking for.
